Hi, I’m huu. I’m a 25 year old IT engineer currently residing in Lithuania.
In the past I used to assist with osu!'s [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Project_Loved) as well as used stream to on Twitch.
To reach me elsewhere, see the block of text below for other relevant social media.

Currently no longer active on Github as I am no longer involved with osu! as I used to be.
