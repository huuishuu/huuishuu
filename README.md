Hi, I’m huu. I’m a 22 year old college IT student currently residing in Lithuania.
I assist with osu!'s [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Project_Loved) as well as stream on Twitch.
To reach me elsewhere, see the block of text below for other relevant social media.

As of June 2021, I've wrapped up my 2nd year of my studies, primarily focusing on the basics of Oracle SQL, light web development and programming in C#.
*(don't expect me to be any good at these though, I have no idea what I'm doing)*

Thinking of eventually putting up some of my college programs up on GitHub as a way of preserving the things I've made though likely in a private repository to avoid complaints from my college.
